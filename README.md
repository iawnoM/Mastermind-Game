# Mastermind-Game
A C++ Object-Oriented game with user input and test-based gameplay. 

This game was created for a school project and uses object oriented programming to recreate a text-based video game based off IRL game. Numbers are used rather than colors for guessing and feedback due to ease and conciseness of code. 

During play, the solution appears when it is generated so that it can be guessed correctly, but the print line can be commented out easily.
